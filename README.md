# Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE) Adequacy Rates in Bone Specimen

## Project Overview

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for a scientific project focused on the Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE) of bone specimens collected during biopsy/FNA procedures. The goal of this project is to assess the adequacy rates of bone specimens during ROSE and to explore the influence of different malignancy types on these outcomes. Our study is rooted in the analysis of 86,360 ROSE cases, focusing on 3,337 bone specimens, at a large cancer center between January 2015 and July 2023.

## Background

ROSE plays a crucial role in biopsy/FNA procedures by providing immediate feedback on the sample quality, thus reducing the need for repeat procedures and facilitating timely ancillary tests. However, the challenges associated with bone biopsies necessitate a deeper understanding of adequacy rates and potential impacts of malignancy types on these rates.

## Methods

Our study utilized a retrospective cohort analysis approach, employing Pythonâ€™s natural language processing libraries to analyze pathology reports and concurrent surgical reports. By extracting diagnostic and metastatic cancer type data, we were able to calculate and stratify the adequacy rates of bone biopsy/FNA by tumor type. A two-proportion Z-test was used to determine statistical significance when comparing these rates to the overall adequacy statistics for all specimens.
